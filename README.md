# Final-Project
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, December 2020

## Theme
Because the theme is "under pressure", we thought it might be a good idea to create a 2D bullet hell shooter. The pressure in the game is came from the large amount of bullets.

## Game Play
Objective: The objective of the game is to complete all three levels without running out of lives. The difficulty will increase by the levels. Each level has a boss that the                play have to defeat to progress.

Control: Shooting - Z
         Using Spellcard - X
         Movement - arrow keys or I for up, K for down, J for left, and L for right
         Slow Mode - hold left shift
         
Explanation: For the player's status, highscore is the highest score the player gets during the gameplay while score is the one that the player can see during playing. Lives means how many times you can get hit before gameover and Spellcards indicates how many spellcards you have left(Spellcards are powerful attack for the player to get out of troubles, but using spellcards during bosses' spellcard attack will result in not being able to receive bonus score). Power determines how strong the player's basic shooting attack is. The more the power is, the more Yinyang Orbs(also known as options in the game) the player will have. By getting close to the bullet, which is a dangerous move, the players can increase their graze points. At the end of the level, the player will be rewarded with score for their high graze points.
About the control, because the game is designed to be even hard to dodge the bullets, the player can hold left shift key to move slowly for more precise movement. IKJL are the alternate keys for the moving controls because some of the laptops have small arrow keys.
In the main menu, music room is a feature to listen to some of the best music from Touhou project series.

## Impediments
The time limit is quite strict. We used to want to make three full-length levels with two or more difficulty selections. However, because of the limited time, we decided to make a boss rush kind game with three levels and different bullet patterns, themes, and music. Besides, we were also planned to have a save system for the highscore, but didn't work out.

## Implementation
We used Unity as our game engine. Because our game is intended to be a fan game, most of the resources, such as sprites and music, are used from the original game.
Tianyang helped create and arrange the sprites and textures.
Dongxin wrote code for the game system and controls. He also designed some of the bullet patterns.
Nicole made and found music and sounds for the game, and she also helped create the main menu.

## References
Touhou Project Series, which is created by Team Shanghai Alice. The creator published a lot of 2D bullet hell games with the characters within. What is special abou this series is that the creator really supports the derivatives(including fan games, comics, merchandises, and so forth) made by the fans. People can even publish or sell their works. As a result, the series is heavily depended on fan made stuffs.

## Future Development
We might keep working on this project to improve it into a full-length bullet hell game.
